# AI-Powered Features Documentation

## Overview

The AWS AI Cost Calculator includes advanced AI-powered analysis features that provide intelligent insights and optimization recommendations using Amazon Bedrock.

## Features

### 1. AI-Powered Budget Analysis

The budget analyzer uses Claude 3 Haiku to analyze your AWS costs and provide:

- **Executive Summary**: High-level overview of your AI spending
- **Cost Pattern Analysis**: Identifies trends and anomalies
- **Intelligent Insights**: Context-aware observations about your usage
- **Risk Assessment**: Highlights potential cost risks

### 2. Optimization Engine

The optimization engine provides:

- **Service-Specific Recommendations**: Tailored advice for each AWS service
- **Project-Specific Strategies**: Custom recommendations for your AI projects
- **Implementation Roadmap**: Phased approach to cost reduction
- **ROI Calculations**: Expected savings and payback periods

### 3. Key Metrics

#### Optimization Score (0-100)
- **90-100**: Excellent - Minor optimizations available
- **70-89**: Good - Moderate optimization potential
- **50-69**: Fair - Significant savings opportunities
- **0-49**: Poor - Major optimization needed

#### Savings Opportunities
- **Model Optimization**: Switch to cost-effective models
- **Batch Processing**: Convert real-time to batch workloads
- **Caching Strategy**: Implement intelligent caching
- **Service Migration**: Move to more efficient services
- **Reserved Capacity**: Commit to save on predictable workloads

## How It Works

### 1. Data Collection
```python
# The system collects:
- Current month costs by service
- Resource discovery data
- Project attribution information
- Historical patterns (when available)
```

### 2. AI Analysis
```python
# Using Amazon Bedrock:
- Analyzes cost patterns
- Identifies inefficiencies
- Generates recommendations
- Calculates potential savings
```

### 3. Recommendation Generation
```python
# Provides:
- Specific action items
- Implementation steps
- Expected savings
- Effort estimates
```

## Example Recommendations

- **Use Claude 3 Haiku** for simple queries (97.5% cost reduction)
- **Implement prompt caching** for repeated queries (90% savings)
- **Enable batch processing** for non-real-time needs (50% savings)

### For Amazon Kendra
- **Optimize index size** by filtering documents (30% savings)
- **Implement query caching** for common searches (40% savings)
- **Consider OpenSearch** for basic search needs (80% savings)

### For AWS Lambda
- **Right-size memory allocation** (30% savings)
- **Use Graviton processors** (20% savings)
- **Implement async processing** (20% savings)

## Implementation Roadmap

  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "bedrock:InvokeModel",
        "bedrock:InvokeModelWithResponseStream"
      ],
      "Resource": "arn:aws:bedrock:*:*:model/*"
    }
  ]
}
```

- Share successes across teams

## Troubleshooting

### AI Analysis Not Working
1. Check Bedrock access in your region
2. Verify IAM permissions
3. Review error logs
4. Fallback analysis still provides value

### Inaccurate Recommendations
1. Ensure complete resource discovery
2. Verify cost data is current
3. Check project attribution accuracy
4. Provide feedback for improvements

### Missing Savings Opportunities
1. Check if all services are included
2. Verify date range is appropriate
3. Ensure resources are tagged correctly
4. Review service-specific configurations
